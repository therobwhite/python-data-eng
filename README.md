nypd_analysis.py: error: the following arguments are required: -i/--input_filepath, -d/--output_db_filepath


Improvements
Testing could be extended if time allowed to create similar fixtures for "top 4" problem etc.
Also add tests to look at edge cases e.g. what if there aren't 4 PD categories in an age_group

Could also look to reimplement using a Class
